# cs61a-sp2023

Studying CS61A is the second most frequent thing I've started in my life (the first being learning Japanese). This time, I finally went through it from start to finish (although I skipped the Scheme part but still casually learned SQL). I can now say that I've learned Python. CS61a is a great course, and now I am officially an honorary alumnus of the BKL. Love from Tokyo.
